# k-nearest-neighbors
Simple k-nearest-neighbors algorithm.
Individual clusters are generated by first placing a single point on the canvas (uniform across the canvas). Then the clusters
around the canvas are generated using a normal distribution. Note that this normal distribution around the cluster is not
perfect to make sure that all points are within the canvas (Might change this later).
